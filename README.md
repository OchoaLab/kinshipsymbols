# kinshipsymbols: a LaTeX package providing math symbols for papers and presentations in statistical genetics

![Preview of examples/test-color.pdf](examples/test-color.png)

This LaTeX package defines consistent mathematical symbols for statistical genetics, particularly relating to the kinship model and FST.

In addition to providing a long list of symbols, the package has two options that alter the behavior of some of the most common symbols.
Option `color` highlights genotypes (blue), kinship coefficients (dark green), and the standard ancestral allele frequency estimator (red), which is useful for Beamer presentations.
Option `noT` removes the ancestral population T superscript from all symbols that contain it (for simpler presentations).
